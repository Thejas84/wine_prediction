# Wine Quality Prediction Using SVM

**About the Project**

This project aims to predict the quality of white wine based on its chemical properties using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The dataset is sourced from the YBI Foundation and contains various features that describe the chemical composition of white wine. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and future prediction.
<br><br>
**Features**

**Data Preprocessing:** Standardization of the dataset using StandardScaler.

**Model Training:** Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the preprocessed dataset.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix and classification report.

**Future Prediction:** Predict the quality of wine based on new data sample

<br><br>
**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the White Wine Quality dataset from the YBI Foundation. It contains several features like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol
